# Container Orchestration and Automation

## Overview
This repository contains various projects related to container orchestration, automation, and AI/ML deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, Streamlit, and cloud-based solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Aiml EC2 Deployment
This project focuses on deploying AI/ML models on AWS EC2 instances. It includes setting up an environment, containerizing models, and deploying them using cloud infrastructure.

### 2. Docker Networking and Connectivity
A comprehensive guide on how Docker networking works. It includes different networking modes like bridge, host, and overlay, and practical implementations.

### 3. Docker Volumes
This project explores persistent storage management in Docker using volumes. It demonstrates how to create, mount, and manage volumes for data persistence.

### 4. Evidently AI
A project that integrates Evidently AI for monitoring and evaluating machine learning models. It helps in tracking data drift and model performance over time.

### 5. Minikube with Docker on Linux
A step-by-step guide to setting up Minikube on Linux using Docker as a driver. It includes Kubernetes deployment basics and workload management.

### 6. MySQL
A database project that sets up a MySQL server, demonstrates CRUD operations, and integrates with applications using SQL queries.
