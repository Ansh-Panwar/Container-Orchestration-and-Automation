## üß™ Projects

1. [`Aiml EC2 Deployment`](Aiml%20ec2%20deployment)  
   This project focuses on deploying AI/ML models on AWS EC2 instances. It includes setting up an environment, containerizing models, and deploying them using cloud infrastructure.

2. [`Docker Networking and Connectivity`](Docker%20Networking%20and%20Connectivity)  
   A comprehensive guide on how Docker networking works. It includes different networking modes like bridge, host, and overlay, and practical implementations.

3. [`Docker Volumes`](Docker%20Volumes)  
   This project explores persistent storage management in Docker using volumes. It demonstrates how to create, mount, and manage volumes for data persistence.

4. [`Evidently AI`](Evidently%20AI)  
   A project that integrates Evidently AI for monitoring and evaluating machine learning models. It helps in tracking data drift and model performance over time.

5. [`Minikube with Docker on Linux`](Minikube%20with%20Docker%20on%20Linux)  
   A step-by-step guide to setting up Minikube on Linux using Docker as a driver. It includes Kubernetes deployment basics and workload management.

6. [`MySql`](MySql)  
   A database project that sets up a MySQL server, demonstrates CRUD operations, and integrates with applications using SQL queries.

7. [`Titanic Survival Predictor`](Titanic_Survival_Predictor)  
   A machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

8. [`Hello World`](hello_world)  
   A simple "Hello World" project, likely a test setup for new tools or frameworks.

9. [`Machine Learning App`](machine_learning_app)  
   A generic ML application that may include various models, data pipelines, and deployment techniques.

10. [`SQL with Streamlit`](sql_with_streamlit)  
   An interactive web application built with Streamlit that connects to an SQL database, allowing users to query and visualize data.

11. [`Streamlit App`](streamlit_app)  
   A web-based application built using Streamlit. It serves as an example of deploying and running interactive web applications.

12. [`Jenkins-Orchestration`](Jenkins-Orchestration)  
   Automating CI/CD processes using Jenkins pipelines, scripts, and Docker integration.

13. [`Docker-Bake`](Docker-Bake)  
   Use of Docker Bake to build multiple containers in parallel using a structured bake file.

14. [`Bakery Foundation`](Bakery_Foundation)  
   A foundational setup, likely representing a microservice or application infrastructure base.

15. [`Microservices Architecture using Docker Swarm`](Microservices%20Architecture%20using%20Docker%20Swarm)  
   Practical example of managing microservices with Docker Swarm orchestration.

16. [`.devcontainer`](.devcontainer)  
   Configuration for container-based development environments (e.g., VS Code Dev Containers).
